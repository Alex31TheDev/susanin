He began to speak and told me his name, "Amogus", and that he was here to send an important warning. He saw I was interested in the once great Sus kingdom, and I would be one to make good use of his message. I was very concerned by what he said next: "The Imposters never went away. They must have burried their ship to avoid detection and trick me into thinkig they were gone. They slept peacefully in the cold mountains, only to emerge again one thousand years later. I was immediately informed when their ship was once again active. I think they are preparing a new attack.".  After saying this, he dissapeared with the bright light quickly following. I must urgently inform S.U.S. Laboratories about this imminent attack.`

1 - Sus Archeological Area

The Sus Archeological Area is a large zone situated inside the Sakha Republic, encompassing 1,220,800 square kilometers. It contains the ruins of the Sussarian Empire, as well as areas thought to have been inhabited by the 7 Sussarian Tribes. Among the ruins, there have been found cave paintings, tools used in farming, dated to around 17000 BC, and the burried bodies of dead inhabitants. These are signs that a advanced culture ruled over the area even before the formation of the Sussarian Empire. It appears that the Sus people knew of this area. Their findings may be stored inside yet to be decyphered portions of the Sus Archives.

Central Zone
The Central Zone of the Sus Archeological Area is the area colonized, over time, by the Sussarian Empire, and points to their highly advanced nature. Inside it were found artifacts ranging from those produced by an Bronze Age civillization, to those of an Industrial civillization, indicating a very quick technological advancement. Some of these findings include: very early farming tools, early ceramic and glass pottery, human and animal equipment, hand or water powered mechanism such as watermills, ruins of brick buildings, most of which had intricate architecture, covered by ruins of steel reinforced concrete buildings, and steel parts indicating modern machinery.`

Currently, the Engine can calculate both single-player and multiplayer positions, as well as orgies. The Engine has been written in the Hungarian and Polish programming languages and runs naturally on Equilaterum. Modern versions of the algorithm, like Cockfish, can calculate positions up to 3,000 moves deep.

        The Sussarians, they're among us. They are humans, just like us. They have incredible Sexing capabilities. Using the Mogus scale for sex, the average Sussarian is capable of hitting 2 million points (2 megamoguses) while I am capable of doing 300 kilomoguses, with a theoretical upper limit of 400 kilomoguses.

In addition to its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Sussarian literature, and has significantly influenced the Sussarian language.
        
        The Book of Sus was originally created by the C.O.C.K (Committee of Cool Kids) and was revealed to S.U.S Laboratories incrementally over a period of at least 24 years. Scholars regard the Book of Sus as the most important miracle and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with the Sus Archives in 1984. The word Sus occurs some 200 times in the text itself, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Book of Sus.
        
        The Book of Sus has been wiped from public servers following a catastrophic Q-activation event on December 16, 2021, 08:38 UTC. Only 186 pages of the Book of Sus are currently available to the public, however, it looks like 95%+ of the Sus content and lore is in the other pages.`
